# üß∞ Utilities

Welcome to **Utilities**, a personal collection of modular, production-ready libraries written and maintained for personal and project use.

This repository serves as a **central hub** or **gallery** for various standalone libraries (e.g., math utilities). Each library is managed in its own dedicated branch and is designed to be cloned or pulled directly into other projects.

---

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `main`  
  - Serves as a **read-only showcase** of all libraries.
  - Contains the production/stable versions.
  - **Not intended to be cloned or integrated directly into other projects.**

- `<library-name>` branches  
  - Each library has its own branch, named after the library (e.g., `math`, `string-utils`, etc.).
  - These branches are **actively maintained**, and are the **ones you should clone** or **pull** from for integration.
  - Branches may include their own `README.md` files and documentation relevant to that specific library.

## ‚úÖ Usage

To use a specific library in your project:

1. Browse the repository branches.
2. Identify the library you want (e.g., `math`).
3. Clone only that branch:

```bash
git clone --single-branch --branch math https://github.com/your-username/Utilities.git
